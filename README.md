# CS-210
My portfolio for CS-210: Programming Languages at SNHU

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The program was supposed to display a list of every item bought from Corner Grocer within a day and also display how many times it was bought from the store. Allow user to access the number of times item was bought by entering the item name. Also create a histogram and display based on the same data set.

What did you do particularly well?
  I used in-line comments to explain what the program is doing. I divided the functionality between C++ and Python, giving each language a different kind of task to complete. I like the functions in Python a lot especially.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Some of the spacing of the user menu could have been more consistent. I wish I had found a new way to loop through without returning 0, becuase right now the program prints 0 to the console in random places where it doesn't need to be there, but that was the solution I found to the while loop for the time being.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I had trouble choosing which method of opening the file I should use for the histogram function. I was trying to create a new file each time and this was producing an error when the file was already existing. I solved this by keeping the file and using the write feature instead.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Working between two languages will prove especially useful in my future career as a programmer. Also the user input handling of a menu-based program C++ program skills will transfer to other menu-based programs like this. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  It's readable because of the comments included. I also used proper spacing, making it easy to read for the programmer. It could be made more adaptable by accessing the file my_file.txt from current directory rather than from a place in my computer's memory.
